# Scrapping-and-object-detection
Scrapping traffic images from a Singapore government agency and detecting the cars  

The scrapping part uses Selenium and works with Firefox, if user wants to run it on chrome, webdriver_manager needs to be changed.  
The folder area_pictures contains the scrapped images and output_area_pictures contains the images with the cars detected.  
The number of cars in a particular image can be known by running the relative code in the notebook (it will be commented)
